The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000 
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 3 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it\'s the only recommended country.
