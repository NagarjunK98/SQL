This table does not have a primary key, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id

Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2)
where person1 < person2.

Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+

Result table:
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |

| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).
